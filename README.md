# Hey, I'm Ross 👋

I'm a passionate and self-driven software developer based in Scotland, with a background in both Computing and Accounting. After earning my HND in Accounting, I pivoted into tech and am on track to graduate with a First-Class Honours Degree in Computing from Glasgow Caledonian University. Now I bring a sharp analytical mindset and strong technical skills into everything I build.

### 👨‍💻 What I'm Working On

Right now, I’m focused on sharpening my skills for the **JPMorgan Software Engineer Program**. I’m currently preparing by improving my Python fundamentals, learning system design patterns, and building out clean, portfolio-worthy projects.

Some of my current and recent projects include:
- **Logura** – A freelancer productivity app I’m designing and building from scratch using **React Native** and **Firebase**. It includes time tracking, weekly summaries, client voice notes, and project organisation tools. It’s my take on making freelance life less chaotic.
- **Fitxel** – A fitness accountability app built for everyday gym-goers. It allows users to log workouts, track consistency, and view simple progress metrics. Fitxel focuses on building real discipline, not chasing aesthetic perfection — and features a custom-built algorithm that generates workouts tailored to each user’s fitness goals, preferences, and available equipment. I’m building it mobile-first with a clean, calming design system and weekly insights to keep users motivated.
- **AW Sports Admin Dashboard** – A custom-built, highly dynamic order and enquiry management system for a client in the sportswear space. Features include WhatsApp integration, caching, pagination, and dynamic product customisation options.
- **Cameron Tech Solutions** – My web design business, where I build modern websites for small businesses at affordable rates. I’ve created reusable components, admin interfaces, and booking systems that solve real-world client needs.

### 🔍 What I'm Learning

I’m always levelling up. Currently exploring:
- **Python** – Building clean backend logic, solving algorithmic problems, and preparing for technical interviews.
- **Docker & Firebase** – From containerisation to serverless backends, I love streamlining dev workflows and exploring cloud-first tools.
- **DevOps & Clean Architecture** – I’m obsessed with writing scalable, maintainable code — even for side projects.

### 🎯 My Goals

- Secure a full-time software engineering role
- Become a highly skilled backend or full-stack engineer
- Continue growing **Logura** into a real SaaS product
- Eventually move to **New York** and build something meaningful there

### 🧠 A Bit More About Me

- I started my own business (**Cameron Tech Solutions**), helping small businesses get online with modern, responsive websites. I have put that to one side to focus on securing a professional role.
- I’m an avid **American football player**, currently training as a wide receiver and pushing hard for a starting spot with the Clyde Valley Blackhawks.
- I love building things that help real people, whether it's a better admin system, a sleek product page, or an app that simplifies freelancing life.
